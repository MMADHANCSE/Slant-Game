# 🎮 Slant Game (Java)

This project is a **Java implementation of the Slant Game**, inspired by the original puzzle game created by **Simon Thomas**.

The Slant Game is a logic-based puzzle where the goal is to place diagonal slashes (`/` and `\`) inside a grid so that the numbers around the grid correctly indicate how many lines touch each point.

---

## 🧩 Game Description

- The game consists of a grid of cells.
- Each cell can contain either:
  - `/`
  - `\`
- Numbers placed at the intersections indicate how many lines must meet at that point.
- The player must place slants so that **all numeric constraints are satisfied**.

This project focuses on implementing the core game logic and mechanics in **Java**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives of This Project
- Implement the Slant Game using **Java**
- Apply **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles
- Validate player moves according to puzzle rules
- Provide a playable and extendable game structure
  
## 🚀 Features

- Java-based implementation
- Logical validation of slant placement
- Grid-based puzzle structure
- Console / GUI based gameplay (depending on implementation)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Java (JDK 8+)**
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Basic data structures (arrays, lists)

---

## 🏗️ Design & Architecture
The project follows a modular design:

---

### Core Components
- **Grid** – Represents the game board
- **Cell** – Stores the slash type or empty state
- **Constraint Checker** – Validates numeric rules
- **Game Controller** – Manages game flow and user interaction
- **Main Class** – Entry point of the application

This separation improves:
- Readability
- Maintainability
- Future enhancements
